					<li>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Information automatically collected
					Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is
					collected automatically when you visit our App.</p>
				<p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the App. This information does
					not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage
					information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
					preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our App
					and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation
					of our App, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
				<p>The information we collect includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage and performance information
						our servers automatically collect when you access or use our App and which we record in log files. Depending
						on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and
						settings and information about your activity in the App (such as the date/time stamps associated with your
						usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you use), device
						event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called &#39;crash dumps&#39;) and
						hardware settings).</li>
					<li>Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet or other device
						you use to access the App. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as
						your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type,
						hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system and system configuration
						information.</li>
					<li>Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device&#39;s location, which can be
						either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device
						you use to access the App. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data
						that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect
						this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your
						device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.
						Information collected through our App. We collect information regarding your geolocation, mobile device,
						push notifications, when you use our App.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you use our App, we also collect the following information:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Geolocation Information. We may request access or permission to and track location-based information from
						your mobile device, either continuously or while you are using our App, to provide certain location-based
						services. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device&#39;s settings.</li>
					<li>Mobile Device Access. We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device,
						including your mobile device&#39;s storage, sensors, and other features. If you wish to change our access or
						permissions, you may do so in your device&#39;s settings.</li>
					<li>Mobile Device Data. We automatically collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model and
						manufacturer), operating system, version information and system configuration information, device and
						application identification numbers, browser type and version, hardware model Internet service provider
						and/or mobile carrier, and Internet Protocol (IP) address (or proxy server). If you are using our App, we
						may also collect information about the phone network associated with your mobile device, your mobile
						device’s operating system or platform, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device
						ID and information about the features of our App you accessed.</li>
					<li>Push Notifications. We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or certain
						features of the App. If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them
						off in your device&#39;s settings.
						This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, for troubleshooting
						and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Information collected from other sources
					We may collect limited data from public databases, marketing partners, social media platforms, and other
					outside sources.</p>
				<p>In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers and services to you and update our
					records, we may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing
					partners, affiliate programs, data providers, social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.
					This information includes mailing addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, intent data (or user
					behavior data), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, social media profiles, social media URLs and custom
					profiles, for purposes of targeted advertising and event promotion. If you interact with us on a social media
					platform using your social media account (e.g. Facebook or Twitter), we receive personal information about you
					such as your name, email address, and gender. Any personal information that we collect from your social media
					account depends on your social media account&#39;s privacy settings.</p>
				<ol start="2">

					<li>To send you marketing and promotional communications. We and/or our third-party marketing partners may use
						the personal information you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with your
						marketing preferences. For example, when expressing an interest in obtaining information about us or our
						App, subscribing to marketing or otherwise contacting us, we will collect personal information from you. You
						can opt-out of our marketing emails at any time (see the &quot;WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?&quot; below).
						Deliver targeted advertising to you. We may use your information to develop and display personalized content

						analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to
						evaluate and improve our App, products, marketing and your experience. We may use and store this information
						in aggregated and anonymized form so that it is not associated with individual end users and does not
						include personal information. We will not use identifiable personal information without your consent.</li>
				</ul>
				<ol start="3">
					<li>WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect
					your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</p>
				<p>We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information
						for a specific purpose.</li>
					<li>Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate
						business interests.</li>
					<li>Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal
						information to fulfill the terms of our contract.</li>
					<li>Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to
						comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process,
						such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet
						national security or law enforcement requirements).</li>
					<li>Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate,
						prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations
						involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation
						in which we are involved.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following
					situations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations
						of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
						another company.</li>
					<li>Affiliates. We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those
						affiliates to honor this privacy notice. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint
						venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.</li>
					<li>Business Partners. We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products,
						services or promotions.</li>
					<li>Other Users. When you share personal information (for example, by posting comments, contributions or other
						content to the App) or otherwise interact with public areas of the App, such personal information may be
						viewed by all users and may be publicly made available outside the App in perpetuity. If you interact with
						other users of our App and register for our App through a social network (such as Facebook), your contacts
						on the social network will see your name, profile photo, and descriptions of your activity. Similarly, other
						users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our App, and view your
						profile.</li>
				</ul>
				<ol start="4">
					<li>HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to
					certain information about you.</p>
				<p>Our App offers you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details
					(like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
					information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending
					on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, profile
					picture as well as other information you choose to make public on such social media platform.</p>
				<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or
					that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant App. Please note that we do not control, and are not
					responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We
					recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal
					information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>
				<ol start="5">
					<li>IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</p>
				<p>Our servers are located in. If you are accessing our App from outside, please be aware that your information
					may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we
					may share your personal information (see &quot;WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?&quot; above), in
					and other countries.</p>
				<p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may
					not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We
					will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy
					notice and applicable law.</p>
				<ol start="6">
					<li>WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers who
					advertise, but are not affiliated with, our Website.</p>
				<p>The App may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to
					other websites, online services or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you
					provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We
					are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties,
					including other websites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the App. You should review
					the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>
				<ol start="7">
					<li>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice
					unless otherwise required by law.</p>
				<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
					privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
					other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
					longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
				<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
					or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
					been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
					further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
				<ol start="8">
					<li>HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security
					measures.</p>
				<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
					security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
					information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed
					to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
					parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
					information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
					information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the App within a secure
					environment.</p>
				<ol start="9">
					<li>DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
				<p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the App, you
					represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
					minor dependent’s use of the App. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age
					has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data
					from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please
					contact us at topotool(at)2metric(dot)com.</p>
				<ol start="10">
					<li>WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
				<p>If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
					information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can
					find their contact details here: <a
						href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.
				</p>
				<p>If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available
					here: <a
						href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html">https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html</a>.</p>
				<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at topotool(at)2metric(dot)com.
				</p>
				<p>Account Information
					If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account,
					you can:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from
					our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot
					problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with applicable legal
					requirements.</p>
				<p>Opting out of email marketing: You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on
					the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will
					then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with you, for example to
					send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond
					to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you may:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
				</ul>
				<ol start="11">
					<li>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
					(&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
					your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
					recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
					browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
					If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
					practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
				<ol start="12">
					<li>DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal
					information.</p>
				<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the &quot;Shine The Light&quot; law, permits our users
					who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about
					categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and
					the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately
					preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit
					your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
				<p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the App, you have
					the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the App. To request removal of such
					data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated
					with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly
					displayed on the App, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from
					all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).</p>
				<ol start="13">
					<li>DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>
				<p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
					&quot;Revised&quot; date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make
					material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such
					changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently
					to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
